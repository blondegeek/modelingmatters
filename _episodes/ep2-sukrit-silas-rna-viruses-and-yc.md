excerpt: Modeling Matter(s) is a podcast that showcases early career researchers and the mental models they use to investigate the world around us. Sukrit Silas is an expert in RNA viruses, an enthusiastic dinner party host, and one of my favorite story tellers. In this podcast, Sukrit and I discuss many of the ingredients needed to do good science (e.g. intuition, humility, and knowing what you know and don’t know) and how we learn them. Sukrit also shares his business adventures (including reverse culture shock) in running clinical trials in India for the start-up he and his colleagues started through the prestigious incubator Y Combinator.
